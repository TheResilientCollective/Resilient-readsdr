Title: Translate Models from System Dynamics Software into R
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Jair", "Andrade", email = "jair.albert.andrade@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The goal of 'readsdr' is to bridge the design capabilities from
    specialised System Dynamics software with the powerful numerical tools 
    offered by R libraries. The package accomplishes this goal by parsing 
    'XMILE' files ('Vensim' and 'Stella') models into R objects to construct 
    networks (graph theory), ODE functions for 'deSolve' and 'Stan'.
