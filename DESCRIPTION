Title: Translate models from System Dynamics software into R

Description: The goal of 'readsdr' is to bridge the design capabilities from
    specialised System Dynamics software with the powerful numerical tools 
    offered by R libraries. The package accomplishes this goal by parsing .xmile 
    files (Vensim and Stella) models into R objects to construct networks (graph
    theory), ODE functions for deSolve and Stan.
